# Anormally-Detection-by-tensorflow2
clearwater,VNF,detection,anormally

this project is aimed at using tensorflow to analysis the Gaussian distribution abnormal data through cos similiarity

anyway,GAN is used ,generator contact lstm and anencoder, and discriminator is CNN

datasets is clearwater on kaggle

five trained model is provided on the repository, which provide convicing data for my graduate thesis
